<p>If you are unable to connect to the Tor network, it could be that your Internet Service
Provider (ISP) or another agency is blocking Tor.  Often, you can work around this problem
by using Tor Bridges, which are unlisted relays that are more difficult to block.</p>


<p>Tor bridges are the recommended way to circumvent the Tor censorship. You should always take it as the first option to help you bypass the Tor censorship. However, if you are living in a heavily censored area where all the Tor bridges are invalid, you may need to use some third-party censorship circumvention tools to help you instead. In such a case, you should choose not using Tor bridges to help you bypass the Tor censorship.</p>

<p> Using a third-party censorship circumvention tool may harm your security and/or anonymity. However, in case you do need it, the following is an instruction on how to connect to the Tor network using different censorship circumvention tools:</p>

<blockquote><b>1. VPN</b><br>
1. Establish your connection to the VPN server; 2. Hit the "back" button on this page, going to the first page; 3. Hit the "Connect" button on the first page.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>2. HTTP/Socks Proxy</b><br>
1. Choose not using Tor bridges on this page; 2. Hit the "next" button on this page, going to the Proxy Configuration page; 3. Configure a proxy.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>3. Specialized Tool </b><br>
1. Figure out the listening port of the tool, including the port protocol and the port number; 2. Choose not using Tor bridges on this page; 3. Hit the "next" button on this page, going to the Proxy Configuration page; 4. Configure a proxy.</blockquote>

                                  <p>In some situations, you may want to transfer your traffic through a proxy server before connecting to the Tor network. For example, if you are trying to use a third-party censorship circumvention tool to bypass the Tor censorship, you need to configure Tor to connect to the listening port of that circumvention tool.</p>

<p> The following is a brief introduction on what each blank means and how you may find the proper input value:</p>

<blockquote><b>1. Proxy Type</b><br>
                                  The proxy type is the protocol you use to communicate with the proxy server. Since there are only three options, you can try all of them to see which one works.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>2. Proxy IP/hostname</b><br>
You have to know the address you are trying to connect to. If you are trying to connect to a local proxy, you should try 127.0.0.1 since it means localhost.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>3. Proxy Port number</b><br>
You have to know the port number you are trying to connect to. It should be a positive integer from 1 to 65535. If you are trying to find the listening port number of a well-known censorship circumvention tool, you may simply search it online.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>4. Username and Password</b><br>
If you do not know what they are, just leave them blank to see if the connection will succeed. Because in most cases, you do not need them.</blockquote>''', QtWidgets.QMessageBox.Ok)
